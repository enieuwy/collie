 * ({@link envList}):
 *
 * ```
 * [<agent>:]/<command>[ <arg hint>][=<description>]
 * ```
 *
 * `omp:/fork-in-herdr=Fork this conversation into a new herdr tab` scopes the row to omp panes;
 * a bare `/deploy` applies to every agent (and makes the palette button appear on an agent that
 * ships no catalog at all). An arg hint — anything after a space, before the FIRST `=` — marks the
 * row as arg-taking, so tapping it INSERTS `/cmd ` into the composer instead of submitting it.
 *
 * A LATER entry for the same `agent:/command` pair replaces an earlier one, so appending to the
 * variable (the usual way these grow) corrects a row instead of being silently ignored. An empty
 * scope (`:/wipe`) is REJECTED rather than read as "every agent": the operator was reaching for a
 * narrower rule than they got, and the failure has to be the narrow one.
 *
 * Two grammar costs, both of them separators the list style already spends: a description cannot
 * contain a comma, and an arg hint cannot contain `=` (the first one starts the description, so
 * `/set [key=value]=Set a key` hints `[key` and describes `value]=Set a key`). Everything after
 * that first `=` is description, `=` included. Inventing a second separator that means one thing
 * here and another everywhere else in this file costs more than either.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the shipped catalog (`web/src/lib/agent-commands.ts`) is deliberately
 * limited to commands its sources vouch for on EVERY user's machine, so a plugin- or user-registered
 * command can never be added there. This is the supported way to get one into the palette — and a
 * pane addressed by these rows shows them INSTEAD of the shipped ones, because the palette is a
 * handful of one-thumb shortcuts and a list half-chosen by the operator is worse than either whole
 * one. Exported and pure so the grammar is unit-testable without touching `process.env`.
